# Welcome

Here you can find examples for Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) combined with End to End tests.

### Technologies used

* SpecFlow
* Playwright
* Blazor (PWA)
* bUnit
* (xUnit)

### Prerequisites

dotnet sdk version 6

### Known issues

`dotnet test` does not pick up the tests by itself. IDE is necessary.

If you are using Visual Studio you should:

1) really consider to switch to Rider :)
2) install the xunit nuget for Visual Studio.
